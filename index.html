        <h3>My History</h3>
        <p>I am a 20+ year veteran of the music industry, where I was fortunate enough to earn multiple Grammies as a producer, songwriter and recording engineer.</p>
        <p>As I've watched that industry grow increasingly unstable in recent years, I decided it was time for a change in career paths and began a long process of deciding what was next. Eventually I discovered the world of software development and knew I'd found my next chapter in life.</p>
        <p>Software development has been a natural fit for me so far. There's a strong correlation with both the creative and problem-solving skills that producing music requires, so despite the challenges of learning a new skillset the transition has been comfortable. I find a huge amount of satisfaction in planning and building something with code that accomplishes what it was designed to do.</p>
